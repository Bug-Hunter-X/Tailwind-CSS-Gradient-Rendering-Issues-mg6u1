```javascript
// ... some Tailwind CSS classes ...
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 via-purple-500 to-pink-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
  <!-- Content -->
</div>
```
This corrected code specifies a transition color (`via-purple-500`) between the start and end colors, resulting in a smoother and more visually appealing gradient.  It also ensures that all used colors are within the Tailwind CSS palette.

Furthermore, verify that the Tailwind configuration is correctly set up and that the necessary plugins are installed, if required for custom gradients.
